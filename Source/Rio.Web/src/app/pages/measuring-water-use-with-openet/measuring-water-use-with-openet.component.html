            <p><strong>Tracking water use and demand</strong></p>
            <p>Water use calculations on this trading platform are provided by <a href="https://www.etdata.org/" target="_blank">OpenET</a>
               - a  web-based platform being developed to provide easily accessible, credible estimates of consumptive water use 
               at the field scale. OpenET relies on publicly available satellite and weather station data to estimate 
               evapotranspiration (ET) - water that is transferred from the land to the atmosphere via evaporation from 
               bare soil and transpiration through plant leaves. For irrigated agricultural fields, ET is necessary for 
               plant growth and food production.
               <br>
               <br>
               While several methods already exist for measuring ET at the field scale, they’re expensive, and since they’re
               calculated differently by every consulting group, there isn’t a lot of broad trust in the data.
               <u>Rosedale-Rio Bravo chose to partner with OpenET because it is bringing leading scientists and
                  some of the most commonly used approaches for estimating ET together in one place, helping to 
                  create a shared basis for decision-making.
               </u>

               <br>
               When it launches publicly in 2021, OpenET will significantly increase access to ET data for individual farmers 
               and landowners, giving them the opportunity to see the same data that water managers and regulators are using 
               by providing low-cost, near real-time ET estimates through a widely accessible website. The OpenET platform is 
               currently in a beta version, and data are being provided here for user testing purposes only. However, with 
               further work on model intercomparison and refinements, the objective of OpenET is to provide broadly trusted 
               ET estimates that are well-documented, easily retrieved, and truly representative of the best available science.

               Rosedale Rio Bravo utilizes data from OpenET within this trading platform to account for consumptive use 
               on each assessor’s parcel. This information allows the district to accurately account for and report the
               water consumptively used by each parcel, and gives landowners the ability to accurately track their water
               budgets throughout the year.

            <p><strong>The OpenET Team</strong></p>
            <p>The OpenET project is being led by NASA, Desert Research Institute (DRI) and Environmental Defense Fund with 
               in-kind support from Google Earth Engine. The technical team includes approximately 30 researchers and practitioners 
               from NASA, DRI, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Geological Survey, University of Nebraska, University of 
               Idaho, University of Wisconsin, University of Maryland, California State University Monterey Bay, Google Earth Engine 
               and the web development firm HabitatSeven, with expertise in satellite-based estimation of evapotranspiration, cloud 
               computing, and user-driven website design.

            <p><strong>Multiple ET Models</strong></p>
            <p>OpenET is providing evapotranspiration data derived from several models that integrate satellite and meteorological data 
               to generate estimates at the field scale. Because they are estimates, and because the models utilize different methodologies, 
               they can produce results that diverge from field measurement. However, recent advances in remote sensing of ET have led to 
               significant improvements in our ability to automate these methodologies, and many of these methods are already informing water 
               use decisions across the West.

            <p><strong>Creating an "ensemble" value</strong></p>
            <p>The OpenET project is integrating many of these advances to support further improvements in water management by 
               increasing access to remotely sensed ET data, and building confidence in the data by developing an ensemble value 
               that is endorsed by a community of scientists. The models selected for inclusion in the initial ensemble are already 
               informing water use decisions across the West, but the OpenET project will make it much easier to compare the models 
               at scale, allowing identification of consistent differences between the various methods and for the scientific 
               community to further refine and improve the estimates.
               <br>
               <br> 
               The OpenET team is initiating one of the largest model intercomparison and accuracy assessments conducted to date to 
               improve ET estimates. The results will inform the calculation of the single ensemble value from the full suite of ET 
               models.
               <br>
               <br>
               The data in the accounting platform represents the OpenET team’s preliminary estimate of an ensemble value based on the 
               best available science. However, the science will significantly advance over the coming year as the intercomparison 
               effort progresses and additional lessons are learned.
