            <p><strong>Why was this platform developed?</strong></p>
            <p>In 2014 the state of California passed the Sustainable Groundwater 
               Management Act (SGMA) , which requires that each groundwater basin balance
               their groundwater supply and demand. Rosedale-Rio Bravo Water Storage District
               has developed an online water accounting platform to provide landowners access
               to up-to-date information related to their water supply and consumptive use. 
               Each landowner of record will be able to register on the platform using their
               assessor’s parcel number (APN). The platform will enable landowners to make 
               evaluate their use of water on their property and make informed decisions 
               related to water supply and land use.

            <p><strong>Who can currently participate?</strong></p>
            <p>Any landowner within the Rosedale service area may register to access their
               information. The water accounting platform uses the parcel number as the basis
               of the water budget or “account,” much like a bank account number. The platform
               allows the registered landowner the ability to see information related to parcels they own.

            <p><strong>Is this intended to ever scale beyond the Rosedale service area?</strong></p>
            <p>The platform was developed with open source software and the intent is to allow
               other water districts within the region to utilize the platform. Rosedale believes
               that the platform is an important part of SGMA compliance and that landowners will
               make better decisions when provided the most up-to-date information related to water supply and demand.

            <p><strong>Who is involved in the development of this platform?</strong></p>
            <p>The platform was developed in partnership and with funding assistance from
               Environmental Defense Fund, with technical assistance from WestWater Research,
               Sitka Technologies and Open ET.
