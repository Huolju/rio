                OpenET provides access to more transparent, broadly trusted estimates of water use (evapotranspiration, or ET) 
                generated using publicly available data from multiple satellites and weather data sets. The OpenET project team 
                includes leading national and international experts in remote sensing of ET, cloud computing, water policy, and
                water markets, partnered with nationally recognized web development teams and leaders in the western agriculture 
                and water management communities. Rosedale-Rio Bravo has partnered with the OpenET project to understand and 
                demonstrate how data on evapotranspiration and consumptive use can be utilized to support implementation of the 
                Sustainable Groundwater Management Act in ways that provide value to all stakeholders.

            <p><strong>Rosedale-Rio Bravo Water Storage District</strong></p>
            <p>Rosedale-Rio Bravo Water Storage District (Rosedale) was formed in 1959 by landowners 
               for the purpose of construction and operation of groundwater recharge projects. Rosedale 
               is located to the west of the city of Bakersfield and encompasses around 28,000 acres of 
               irrigated agriculture along with approximately 7,000 acres of urban, industrial and commercial 
               development.  As a member of the Kern Groundwater Authority, Rosedale acts in the capacity of 
               a Groundwater Sustainability Agency (GSA) and has accepted responsibility for developing and 
               implementing an Groundwater Sustainability Plan for its management area. Accordingly, Rosedale 
               has developed an online portal to assist landowners in tracking their water supplies and 
               consumptive use.  The online platform is a tool to assist landowners and inform decisions 
               related to water supply and land use.</p>
